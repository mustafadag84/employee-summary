# employee-summary
## Description:

The app generates an HTML page for a team roster of at least one manager with the potential to add engineers and interns, all based on user input.

## Usage:
While creating this team roster what helped along was implementing and creating constructor classes that contained the following setup:

- Name
- Role
- ID
- Role-specific property (School, link to GitHub profile, or office number)

After prompts are completed. The file is then rendered and written to the output directory where the new team.html is then created. You now have yourself a new team roster ready to be displayed and shown off!
